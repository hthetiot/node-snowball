This stemming module for Node.js provides stemming capability for a variety of languages using Dr. M.F. Porter's Snowball API.
That allow you to get from a word a reduced, inflected (or sometimes derived) word from the original word stem, base or root.

Examples:
> A stemmer for English, for example, should identify the string "cats" (and possibly "catlike", "catty" etc.)
> as based on the root "cat", and "stemmer", "stemming", "stemmed" as based on "stem". A stemming algorithm
> reduces the words "fishing", "fished", and "fisher" to the root word, "fish". On the other hand, "argue",
> "argued", "argues", "arguing", and "argus" reduce to the stem "argu" (illustrating the case where the stem
> is not itself a word or root) but "argument" and "arguments" reduce to the stem "argument".

This library is using bindings to the [libstemmer](http://snowball.tartarus.org/download.html) C library.
It's support
